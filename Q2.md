linkedlist::linkedlist(): This is the constructor for the linkedlist class. It initializes the head node of the linked list with a NULL value for both value and occurance, and sets the next pointer to NULL.

void linkedlist::Add(int added, int place, int o): This function adds a new node to the linked list with the specified value (added), position (place), and number of occurrences (o). There are three cases to consider when adding a new node:

If the place parameter is set to -1, the new node is inserted at the beginning of the list. We make the next pointer of head point to the new node.
If the place parameter is set to -2, the new node is inserted at the end of the list. We traverse the linked list till we find the last node by moving the pointer "n" to the next node using the "next" pointer of the current node and we make this last node next pointer point to the new node and next pointer of the new node will be a NULL.
If the place parameter is set to any other value, the new node is inserted after the node with the specified value. The first pointer n will point to the new node that is being added to the list, while the second pointer p will be used to traverse the linked list to find the position where the new node should be added. The variable place is the value of the node after which the new node should be inserted. Then we use a while loop to traverse the linked list until either the desired position is reached (i.e., p->value equals place) or the end of the list is reached (p->next is NULL). If the desired position is found, the code creates the new node with n->value=added and n->occorunce=o, where added and o are values passed to the function. The new node is then inserted into the linked list by setting n->next to p->next and p->next to n. Note that if the desired position is not found (i.e., p->next is NULL and p->value is not place), the new node is not added to the list.

void linkedlist::Delete(int place): This function removes a node from the linked list with the specified position (place). There are three cases to consider when deleting a node:

If the place parameter is set to -1, the first node in the list is removed. We store the head pointer in a temp pointer of type node. The head node will point to what the next pointer of the first node was pointing at. We then delete the temp pointer. This allows us to free up the space that was allocated to the deleted node.
If the place parameter is set to -2, the last node in the list is removed. We traverse the linked list with 2 temp pointers one pointing at the first node called p and the other pointing at the second node called n till the one pointing at the second node reaches the last node. We then make the next pointer of p NULL and we delete n. This allows us to free up the space that was allocated to the deleted node.
If the place parameter is set to any other value, the node with the specified value is removed. We traverse the linked list with 2 temp pointers one pointing at the first node called p and the other pointing at the second node called n till the one pointing at the second node reaches the node with the specified value or reaches the last node. We then assign the next pointer of p with the next pointer of n and then we delete n. This allows us to free up the space that was allocated to the deleted node. If no such node exists, the function does nothing.

void linkedlist::Print(): This function prints out the values and occurrences of each node in the linked list. Inside the function, a pointer variable "n" of type "node" is declared and initialized to a new node. The node "n" is then set to point to the head node of the linked list "h". A while loop is used to iterate through the linked list until the last node is reached. During each iteration, the pointer "n" is moved to the next node using the "next" pointer of the current node. Then the value and occurrence of the current node is printed to the console using the "cout" statement. When the end of the linked list is reached (i.e., n->next is NULL), the loop terminates and the function ends. 

linkedlist linkedlist::vectorb(vector<int> v): The function first defines an integer variable t to be used for swapping elements of the input vector. It then starts a nested for loop that iterates through each element of the vector and compares it to all the other elements that come after it. If the current element is greater than or equal to the next element, the two elements are swapped. After the vector is sorted, a new linked list object l is created. Two integer variables o and n are also defined and initialized to 1 and -1, respectively. These variables are used to keep track of the occurrence and value of the elements in the input vector as they are added to the linked list. The function then iterates through each element in the sorted vector. If the current element is not the same as the previous element (n), a nested for loop is used to count the number of occurrences of that element in the vector. The element and its occurrence count are then added to the linked list l using the Add function with -2 as the second parameter to indicate that the element should be added to the end of the list. Finally, the linked list l is returned.

int linkedlist::sum(): The function starts by creating a pointer n to a new node and setting its value to the head of the linked list, which is stored in the instance variable h. Next, an integer variable total is initialized to zero, which will be used to store the sum of all the values in the linked list. The function then enters a loop that iterates as long as the next node in the list pointed to by n is not NULL. Within the loop, the value of the current node pointed to by n is added to the total variable, and n is set to point to the next node in the list. Once the end of the list is reached (i.e., n->next is NULL), the value of the last node is added to total and the function returns the final value of total.

As for the main:
A linkedlist object called "l" is created, and four nodes are added to it using the Add function, with the corresponding values, occurrence, and position values.

Then, the linked list is printed using the Print function.

Two nodes are deleted from the linked list using the Delete function but in line 12 since 6 is not in the list the function does nothing.

A vector of integers is created and initialized, and a new linked list object called "t" is created using the vectorb function of the linkedlist class. The new linked list "t" is then printed using the Print function, and the sum of its values is printed using the sum function of the linkedlist class.
