The linked list class is defined in the "linked list.h" header file, which is included in the code.
The class has a constructor, which creates a new node and initializes its value, occurrence, and next pointer to null.
The Add() function adds a new node to the linked list at a specified position. If the position is -1, the new node is added to the beginning of the list. If the position is -2, the new node is added to the end of the list. Otherwise, the new node is added after the node with the specified value.
The Delete() function removes a node from the linked list at a specified position. If the position is -1, the first node is removed. If the position is -2, the last node is removed. Otherwise, the node with the specified value is removed.
The Print() function prints out all the values and occurrences in the linked list.
The vectorb() function takes a vector of integers and returns a linked list that contains the unique values from the vector, sorted in ascending order, and the number of times each value occurs in the vector.
The sum() function calculates and returns the sum of all the values in the linked list.
The linked list class uses a node struct, which contains a value, an occurrence, and a pointer to the next node in the list.
