The insertAfter function declares an iterator variable, uses a for loop initialising the iter variable with the beginning of vector using begin() built in function in vector till it reaches end of vector retrieved by the end() vector build in function.
For each element in the vector, the function checks whether it is equal to v1 by derefrencing the iter variable and comparing it to v1. 
If it is, the function inserts v2 after the current element using the insert function of the vector. 
The insert function returns an iterator pointing to the newly inserted element, so the iter variable is updated to this new iterator to continue the iteration from the inserted element. 
The function returns the boolean variable found.
If v1 is not found in the vector, the function returns false.
If v1 is found in the vector, the function returns true.
In the main:
The code prompts the user to enter a number of integers then creates a vector of that size.
It then declares an iterator variable, uses a for loop initialising the iter variable with the beginning of vector using begin() built in function in vector till it reaches end of vector retrieved by the end() vector build in function.
It then prompts the user to enter integers.
It then  uses a for loop initialising the iter variable with the beginning of vector using begin() built in function in vector till it reaches end of vector retrieved by the end() vector build in function.
It dereferences the iter variable each loop and outputs it to user.
This displays the vector elements.
It then prompts the user to enter a number to insert and the position after which to insert it, and uses the insertAfter function to insert the number at the specified position. 
The updated vector is displayed if the insertion is successful, otherwise a message is displayed indicating that the specified position was not found in the vector.
