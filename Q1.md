The insertAfter function uses an iterator to iterate over the elements of the vector. 
The iterator is initialized to the beginning of the vector, and the loop continues until the iterator reaches the end of the vector. 
For each element in the vector, the function checks whether it is equal to v1. 
If it is, the function inserts v2 after the current element using the insert function of the vector. 
The insert function returns an iterator pointing to the newly inserted element, so the iter variable is 
updated to this new iterator to continue the iteration from the next element. 
If v1 is not found in the vector, the function returns false.
